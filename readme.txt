|App to look for healthier substitute|
+------------------------------------+
This app aim at helping people to find healthier substitutes for products which are mostly unhealthy.
This app uses OpenFoodFact (which may be referred to as OFF) to create a local database of healthy products.
Then it enables the user to look for substitute by chosing which type of product there are looking for.
The "type of product" is referred to as 'categorie' like in the OFF Database.
The app makes the distinction between the maincategories it uses to create its database and all the subcategories a product may have.
You can change easily the search scope of the app by modifying the parameters.py file.
You can launch the app with main.py on python3 if the requirements from requirements.txt are met.
